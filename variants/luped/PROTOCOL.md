# Luped CGM mobile protocol

Luped CGM intentionally contains no PebbleKit JS companion and exposes no
settings page in the Pebble app. A supported mobile app such as Loop or Trio
owns settings, alerts and glucose delivery over a direct watch connection.

The mobile app should send `CONFIGURED: 1` and a `DATA` JSON array whenever
settings change, when a new glucose sample arrives, when its alerts change, and
in response to the watch's one-time startup `COMMAND: "refresh"` request.

`DATA` is a 16-element array (protocol version 1); hosts may send only the
first 10, and the watch reads every field by index:

| Index | Value                                                                                                                  |

|    12 | Last loop completed (ms since Unix epoch), or `null`                                                                   |
|    13 | Closed loop: `1`, open loop: `0`, or `null`                                                                            |
|    14 | Status line the phone formatted (ISF & target as `ISF<tab>target` around the ring), or `null`                          |
|    15 | Name of the host app sending it, such as `"Loop"` or `"Trio"`. The watch doesn't use it yet                            |

**Host app (index 15).** Only one app on the phone should use the watch at a
time: if two apps both host Luped, the watch follows whichever it connects to.
The name lets a future watchface show which app it follows, or refuse a second
one.

**Loop status (indexes 10–13).** In the graph layout Luped shows IOB and COB at
the left of the status strip (dimmed once the loop is stale) and Loop's status
ring with the minutes since the last loop in the top-right corner (on the
status strip on round screens): a full ring for a closed loop, open at the top
for an open loop, green up to 6 minutes, yellow up to 16, red after that, as
Loop's own ring. In an open loop the glucose ring itself is open at the top too.
The phone can replace IOB and COB with a line it formats itself (index 14),
chosen in its settings; it dims the same way. The glucose ring's bottom covers
the middle of the strip; ISF & target is too long for the space before it, so
it comes as `ISF<tab>target` and the target goes between the ring and the CGM
time. A host that sends no loop status
gets neither. The full-screen
ring does not show them.

**Turning them off.** Each of indexes 10–14 may be `null`, and the watch draws
only what it gets: with 10, 11 and 14 `null` the strip is empty, and with 12 and
13 `null` there is no loop ring (and the strip, if it shows anything, is
dimmed, since the loop's age is unknown). Loop's plugin (elbbepTransport 0.3.35+) sends only what the user's Status Line
and Loop Ring choices show: **None** with Loop Ring on (the default) sends 12–13
only, so the loop ring stays; **None** with Loop Ring off sends 10–14 as `null`;
IOB & COB sends 10–13; the phone-formatted lines send 12–13 and 14. While a line
is shown the loop ring stays on, because the line's stale dimming needs the
loop's age.

**History (index 4).** Only the graph uses it, and the full-screen ring has no
graph, so hosts send `[]` there (Loop does since elbbepTransport 0.3.8). The
current value, delta and trend travel in their own fields. When the user turns
full-screen off, the host sends a new `DATA` with the history at once. An empty
history in graph mode shows "Waiting for CGM" in the graph area.

**Alerts (indexes 8-9).** The host evaluates its own glucose alerts and applies
its own mute; the watch has no thresholds. Index 8 is the most important active
glucose alert (urgent low, low, high, predicted low; `0` when none), negative
while the user has turned watch alarms off. Index 9 is
an alert event the host advances every time it fires an alert, including each
repeat of an alert that is still active, whether or not watch alarms are on.
The host persists it so a restart can't reuse the value the watch last saw; it
wraps at 1000. The watch buzzes with the glucose-alarm pattern when the event
differs from the last one it saw and index 8 is above `0` (the same pattern
for every alert). It records the event on every `DATA`, even when it doesn't buzz, and
records the first event after the watchface starts without buzzing. So the
watch buzzes when the host fires, repeats with the host, and stops when the
user acknowledges on the phone. Thresholds and repeat intervals do not travel.
Index 8 colours the ring and the glucose: red for low and urgent low, amber for
high, green otherwise (including predicted low), whatever its sign. The colour
follows the host's alert episode, which ends when glucose recovers, not when the
user acknowledges; with the host's alerts muted or turned off it stays green.
History points in the graph are one neutral colour, and the graph scales to the
readings. Independently, the watch gives one short buzz when its latest
reading becomes 15 minutes old.

The app may send `ERROR` for a temporary data-source error. It may request a
diagnostic snapshot with `COMMAND: "diagnostics"` or reset counters with
`COMMAND: "diagnostics-reset"`. The watch responds on `DIAGNOSTICS`.
The watch may ask the host for an action with `COMMAND`: `mute:<minutes>`
(mute its alerts) or `carbs:<grams>`, with the amount chosen on the watch, or a
signed bolus (below). Each request ends with `@<confirmedAt>`, when the user
confirmed it, in whole seconds since 1970 by the watch's clock (for example
`carbs:30@1798000000`). A resent request keeps the same value. The host refuses
requests without it, and requests confirmed more than 30 seconds ago or more
than 5 seconds in the future, so the watch's clock must be within a few seconds
of the phone's (the Pebble app keeps it in step). The host runs its own checks
and acts only if its plugin declares the capability and its user allowed it; a
request without a valid amount is answered `failed`. The host answers each
request on `RESULT`, kept short as `<action>:<outcome>` (for example `mute:ok`,
`signedbolus:refused`, `carbs:ok`); outcomes are `ok`, `refused`, `ignored` (the
plugin doesn't offer it) and `failed`, and the reason is in the host's log.
Luped shows the `RESULT` text in the status strip under the ring for a minute or
until the next reading, with a short buzz for `ok` and a double buzz otherwise.

### Signed boluses

Boluses are only ever signed; there is no unsigned bolus request (`bolus:` and
`forcedbolus:` are not commands). Luped doesn't send signed boluses yet
(a watchface gets no button presses; it needs a watchapp with a confirmation
screen), and the plugin offers remote bolus only once that exists.

- **Session key, phone to watch:** `COMMAND auth:v1:<sid>:<key>`. `sid` is 16
  lowercase hex digits, `key` 64 (256 random bits). The phone sends a new one
  whenever the watchface starts (its ready handshake) or the Bluetooth session
  opens, and only while its plugin offers remote bolus. The watch keeps the key
  in memory only (never in storage) and forgets it when it restarts; a new key
  makes everything signed with the old one invalid.
- **Request, watch to phone:**
  `COMMAND signedbolus:<units>[:<grams>]@<confirmedAt>#<sid>.<seq>.<mac>`, or
  `signedforcedbolus:` for a bolus the host checks without its recommendation.
  `units` has at most two decimals and is above 0 (`0.01` to `99.99`, no
  leading zeros); the host rounds it down to its pump's step. `grams` is
  optional, a whole number from 1 to 999: the host adds those carbs first, then
  checks the bolus against its recommendation with the carbs included. `seq`
  starts at 1 for each key and goes up by one for each new request.
- **Signature:** `mac` is the first 16 bytes of HMAC-SHA256 with the session
  key over `v1|<sid>|<seq>|<confirmedAt>|<action>|<units>|<grams>` (`grams`
  empty when there are none; every field exactly as sent), as 32 lowercase hex
  digits. With key bytes `00 01 … 1f`,
  `v1|0123456789abcdef|1|1798000000|signedbolus|1.5|30` gives
  `6eb19f16b120d0b9cdb6c36ea5eb56bf`.
- **Checks before the host hears of it:** a current key, the same `sid`, a
  matching MAC, `seq` above the last accepted one, and the 30 s / 5 s timing
  above. A failed check is answered `<action>:refused`.
- **Resends:** a request is passed to the host once. Resending it while the host
  handles it gets nothing back; resending it afterwards gets the same `RESULT`s
  again (`carbs:<outcome>` first when it had carbs, then
  `signedbolus:<outcome>` or `signedforcedbolus:<outcome>`).

The signature proves the request is unchanged and comes from the watchface run
that received this session's key. It doesn't prove who is wearing the watch, and
any app installed under Luped's UUID would get the key too. The host's own
bolus checks (permission, maximum bolus, recommendation unless forced, rate
limits) always still apply.

Alloy turns a watchface's writes off whenever a non-system session (the
host's PPoGATT session) opens or closes, and only a new `Message` turns them
back on. Luped reopens its `Message` (at most every 30 seconds) when a write
fails, so requests and diagnostics are not stuck until the watchface restarts.
Luped appends two fields to the shared diagnostics array: index 38 counts
system pop-ups (notifications, alarms, calls) that covered the watchface, and
index 39 lists the last 5 host-alert buzzes as `[alert event, alert level,
start (ms since Unix epoch), outcome]`. PebbleOS silently drops an app's
vibration while another one plays and cancels it when a system pop-up closes,
so the outcome records whether a pop-up covered the watchface during the
4.7-second buzz: `-2` the buzz call failed, `-1` not covered, `0` already
covered when the buzz started, otherwise the milliseconds into the buzz. Index
40 counts alert events that arrived while Watch Alarms was off (level 0, no
buzz).

Loop delivers these messages over its own PPoGATT session (the watch stays
connected to the Pebble app at the same time) through the LupedSmartwatchKit
plugin. The phone side of this protocol is the `LupedKit` library in
[elbbepTransport](https://github.com/dabear/elbbepTransport), which Loop links
and other apps such as Trio can share.

There is no watch-side periodic glucose fetch timer in this variant. Glucose is
pushed by the host; the startup refresh request exists only to restore state
after the watchface starts.

The CrimsonBear variant keeps its own 16-element layout with watch-evaluated
thresholds (`src/embeddedjs/protocol.js`); it is unaffected.
