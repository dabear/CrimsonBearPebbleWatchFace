// Luped asks for its own XS machine instead of the default 32 KB static block:
// with that block its slot heap was ~94% and its chunk heap ~87% full, so any
// new feature ran out of memory. Larger than the static block, the firmware
// takes these from the app heap (needs PebbleOS 4.21+, see PebbleOS #1621).
// Measured on a Pebble Time 2 (PebbleOS 4.41.2): slots ~50% and chunks ~41% used,
// with 28.7 KB of app heap left for PebbleOS; 64 KB in total also ran (16.4 KB left).
#define LUPED_XS_STACK (4 * 1024) // peak use 2.2 KB

// Memory counters only in a measuring build (scripts/build-release.sh
// --measure-memory defines LUPED_XS_INSTRUMENTATION). When app logging is on as
// the watchface starts, they wake the watch every second for as long as it runs,
// and the watchface keeps them after logging is turned off. Release builds had
// them from 0.1.11 to 0.1.20, when the battery lasted about 6 days instead of 9-10.
